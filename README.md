# Chocolate

Layout container for Bubble Tea the easy way ;) .... *hopefully*
Chocolate is meant to create complex and responsive layouts with
themes via flavour working consistent and without hassle together
in TUI applications.

## State

This is a very early state and in theory the whole API can change
at any time.
Still now is the best time to get *ANY* feedback to change the way
in the right direction if needed.

To get started, please see the [examples](https://github.com/mfulz/chocolate/tree/master/examples)

## Priority

For now the highest priority is the documentation and afterwards
API stability.

*stay tuned*
